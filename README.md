## Capstone project scenario overview: Working for Salifort Motors     
About the company
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.        

## Your business case
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful. 


# PACE- Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute
## 1. Define the Problem and Objectives

- **Understand the Business Problem:**
  - The objective is to predict employee turnover and suggest ways to improve retention.

- **Set Clear Objectives:**
  - Design a model that predicts employee turnover to help increase employee retention at Salifort Motors.
  - Identify key factors influencing employee retention and suggest actionable strategies to improve it.

## 2. Data Collection

- **Identify Data Sources:**
  - Results of employee surveys.

- **Gather Data:**
  - Organize data into single source (DataFrame).

## 3. Data Understanding (Shown in Jupyter Notebook)

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and characteristics. This includes examining the data types, distributions, and summary statistics.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Use visualization tools to identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies in the data.

- **Identify Key Variables:**
  - Determine which variables are most likely to impact employee turnover based on initial observations and domain knowledge.

## 4. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Handle Missing Data:**
  - Identify and address any missing values. Common strategies include imputation, removal, or using algorithms that can handle missing data.

- **Remove Duplicates:**
  - Check for and remove duplicate records to ensure data quality.

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Standardize or normalize numerical features to bring them to a common scale.
  - Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Identify and handle outliers that could skew the model. This can be done through visualization techniques like box plots or statistical methods.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Create new features that may improve the model's performance. For instance, you could calculate tenure, engagement scores, or derive ratios and interaction terms.

## 5. Data Splitting

- **Split Data into Training and Test Sets:**
  - Divide the data into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. A common split is 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing.

- **Consider Cross-Validation:**
  - Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

## 6. Understand the Tools and Technologies

- **Select Tools and Frameworks:**
  - Choose the appropriate tools and libraries for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling (e.g., Python, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

- **Set Up Environment:**
  - Ensure you have the necessary software, hardware, and access permissions in place to conduct the analysis and modeling.

## 7. Develop a Project Plan

- **Create a Timeline:**
  - Develop a detailed timeline outlining the phases of the project, including milestones and deliverables. 

- **Assign Roles and Responsibilities:**
  - If working in a team, assign specific tasks and responsibilities to team members.

## 8. Documentation

- **Document Initial Findings:**
  - Keep detailed notes on the initial data exploration, assumptions, and any challenges encountered.

- **Maintain Data Documentation:**
  - Create and maintain documentation for the data, including sources, preprocessing steps, and any transformations applied.
